      <h2>Suite it up</h2>

      <p class="blogtext">One of the most memorable trends of the Fall 2020 runways may seem out of place right now. Especially since most of us are still working from home. We’re talking about skirt suits. But coordinating blazers and skirts are more practical than you think.
      Some of our favorite skirt sets were sent down the runways of Miu Miu, Marc Jacobs, Gabriela Hearst, Michael Kors Collection and Prada. We really flipped over the ones boasting belted blazers.
      Sure, you can wear the more structured options to the office (even your home office). Which we highly encourage as long as the skirts aren’t too short. But there are versions that are far more playful featuring miniskirts and/or cropped jackets designed for dressing up on your days off.
      Get ready to suit up this fall by scrolling through the slideshow to find the best skirt suits of the season.

      <h2>Leather Dresses Are the Secret to Trans-Seasonal Dressing Success</h2>
      <div class="img" style="height:230px;">
        <img src="" height=190 px>
      </div>
      <p class="blogtext">Once summer starts we like all of our dresses to be breezy and preferably linen. Fall is (obviously) a different story. We tend to favor heavier fabrics. The period between summer and fall is trickier. We all want something we can wear as soon as we get it and well into October. That’s where leather dresses come in handy.
      Whether you’re OK rocking real leather or will only commit to faux and vegan versions, there’s a dress for you. And there are plenty of styles to choose from. From a sleek slip dress to countless shirtdresses in both mini and midi formats to wrap dresses, you have lots of options to add to your virtual shopping cart.

      <h2>14 Far-From-Basic Black Heels Because We Like Pumps With a Little Personality</h2>
      <div class="img" style="height:230px;">

        Heels have definitely taken a back seat to more comfy footwear since the pandemic hit. After all, no one wants to slip on a pair for a Zoom call when no one can see your feet. While many experts are suggesting high heels won’t make a comeback, we beg to differ. In fact, we’re betting we’ll all want to dress up again. And nothing dresses up an outfit better than black pumps.
        Confession: We’re pretty picky when it comes to black pumps. We’re somewhat flexible on heel height. (We love a wide range, from kitten to towering stilettos.) What isn’t debatable is that they can’t be basic. You know, plain ol’ leather (including patent) or suede iterations that are more about function than form.

      <h2>12 Bold and Beautiful Designer Eyeglasses for Every Face Shape</h2>
      <div class="img" style="height:230px;">

        It used to be that being “forced” to wear eyeglasses meant that you could no longer look cool. But nowadays, fashion houses are doing their best to change that perception by offering some truly stellar styles. Proving that the best eyeglasses not only help you see better — they help you look better.
        Chanel is definitely one of the brands on the forefront of statement eyewear. Luckily, the legendary label just started selling its iconic glasses online. (Fitting given our current state of affairs.) But Chanel isn’t the only big name in the business. Everyone from Gucci to Chloe to Bottega Veneta and even Loewe offer bold frames.

      <h2>Gabi Gregg – OG Fat Girl</h2>

        Gabi Gregg set off on this journey to tackle the infuriating gap for plus size women. She started off a blog about a decade ago to show and pave a path in a way that promotes body positivity while being impeccably stylish, vibrant, and colorful. Her outfits are full of life just like her, and so is her clothing line Premme, which caters to plus sizes. She brought, what she calls ‘the fatkini’, by collaborating with ‘Playful Promises’ and ‘Swimsuits’, and showed us how it’s done. We need more women like her, and thanks to social media, we get to follow her around.
